# Russian Losses during Invasion on Ukraine

Each hour I run a scrape of an website:

https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html

I find it a good source, because:

>Nothing will be added to this list without visual evidence to back it up.

## Where to look for data:
Check out `losses.md` for the most recent scrape.

In `losses_table.md` I present russian losses in a tabular form.

There is also google spreadsheet version:

## How to use this data for analysis:
To extract all file versions of `losses.md` run `git_export_all_file_versions.sh` [script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12850030/git-getting-all-previous-version-of-a-specific-file-folder), it will export those versions to `/tmp/all_versions_exported` folder.

UPDATE: Since 20/04/2022 `losses.md` contains only Russian losses. See [@oryxspioenkop](https://twitter.com/oryxspioenkop) [tweet](https://twitter.com/oryxspioenkop/status/1516826828173975552).
